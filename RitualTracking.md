# Ritual Tracking

In our project progress, we use scrum master tools to set specific goals and tasks with defined timelines, while also accounting for risks. But what about personal goals? Do we have a system to track our actions toward achieving them?

Ritual is a system designed to set yearly, monthly, weekly, and daily goals. It helps us plan actions purposefully and reminds us why we are doing the work. This "why" motivates us to keep moving forward. As we track our progress day by day, we feel satisfied knowing we've put in the effort. There are no regrets, negative thoughts, or self-doubt holding us back.

I'm on a mission to track all my tasks, from household chores to personal development, mental and physical health, family responsibilities, and career goals. I want to transform myself, not to prove anything to others, but to show my own mind that I can accomplish everything on my list before time runs out.

I learned this system from the Iron Ladies Club, and Iâ€™m grateful for the activities that taught me to believe, that "Anything is possible if I take calculated actions.".
