# Get Homeroom Album

Get Homeroom is a platform where daycare teachers upload photos of our children's activities, along with photos of other kids. While it's great to see them, it can be time-consuming to find all the photos of your child and make an album by endlessly scrolling through the pictures.

Why not create a model that automatically collects and downloads the photos? Using face recognition, it can identify and download only the photos of your child with rename them (e.g., 08Oct24-1.jpg, 08Oct24-2.jpg).

This app is showing how many days ago the photos were uploaded.

With more feature we can make it better version, like...
* Include filters to view photos by date or duration.
* Allow filtering by the child's name so parents can manually find and download their child's photos.
