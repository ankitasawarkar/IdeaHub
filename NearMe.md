# Near Me

The world is now moving online. Whenever we have a question, we search for answers on the Internet. Everyone has an identity online, sharing what they do, think, and aspire to be. People are relocating from cities to states and even countries, often feeling safe when they find familiar chain stores and online shopping options. This makes life easier, but what happens to local shops, especially in India?

In every city street, there are many local shops filled with talent and unique offerings. When we need something local, Google can show us the way, but sometimes it’s not enough. A few decades ago, I would visit local shops that may no longer exist. I often look for specific items like a book or food, but struggle to find the right store.

Something is missing!

For corporate professionals, LinkedIn is a great platform to showcase ideas and skills, helping recruiters connect globally. Why not create something similar for local shops? 

A platform where shopkeepers, artists, and service providers can:
* List all their items, shop details, specialties, new creations, latest models, and special offers.
* Replace traditional paper banners with an online presence that informs nearby customers about their promotions and markdowns.
* 
As a customer, I have specific needs:
* If I want to buy a gift but don’t have time for online shopping, I would love an app that shows me nearby shops with the exact items I’m looking for.
* If I forget my grocery list while rushing to work, I could use the app to send my list to my usual shop, confirm the items, and pay through mobile payment apps like PhonePe, making it convenient to pick up later.

This app won’t sell items online; it will help explore local shops. Home delivery and online payments can be done as usual, but this platform will allow shops—whether a small home shop or a big brand—to create profiles.

Another view point is Skilled artisans like cobblers, bootmakers, carpenters, weavers, embroiderers, tailors, and even specialized teachers often can't find work outside their craft. These individuals can pass on their expertise to the next generation, ensuring their skills continue on a smaller scale. Students can visit these masters to learn and apply their skills, whether for free or at a cost, as agreed.

"Masters of craft, teaching the next generation to keep skills alive and thriving."
